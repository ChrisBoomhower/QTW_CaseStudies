***NOTE: We are Answering Q.19 from the Data Science in R textbook (Pg. 168): "Consider the other parameters that can be used to control the recursive partitioning process. Read the documentation for them in the rpart.control() documentation. Also, carry out an Internet search for more information on how to tweak the rpart() tuning parameters. Experiment with values for these parameters. Do the trees that result make sense with your understanding of how the parameters are used? Can you improve the prediction using them?"***

## Abstract


## Introduction


## Background


## Methods
The steps used for this analysis were: 1)

*Note that code used includes modified versions of R code function examples found in Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Problem Solving, Chapter 2, pages 22-XX , and Chapter 4, pages XXX-XXX [1].*


## Results

### Data Acquisition

```{r include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
source('DataExtractAndClean.R', echo = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
####Load Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(plyr)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(formattable)
library(spam)
```

### Control for Rpart Fits - pg. 22 https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/rpart.pdf

```{r}
rpart.control(minsplit = 20, minbucket = round(minsplit/3), cp = 0.01,
                  maxcompete = 4, maxsurrogate = 5, usesurrogate = 2, xval = 10,
                  surrogatestyle = 0, maxdepth = 30, ...)
```
