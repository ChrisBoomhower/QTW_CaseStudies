    "## Abstract\n",
    "While the history of financial trade markets as we know them today spans centuries, the adoption of Python to study market trends has really only gained traction since 2005 [4,8]. The language has been used to study everything from historical stock price trends to rolling correlation and linear regression. This case study is performed to demonstrate Python's effectiveness for studying stock cumulative returns and to test the principles of short, intermediate, and long term momentum. The dataset analyzed consists of a mock-up portfolio of five semiconductor industry stocks. Prices were pulled over a ten year timeframe and cumulative returns explored. Momentums were calculated for various lookback and holding periods with the expectation that short and long term periods would exhibit inverted outcomes and intermediate term periods would exhibit a continued trend over future periods of similar length. Finally, research's theory for best strategy being a lookback period of one year with a holding period of three months is tested using this portfolio data [7]. Next steps, including use of the R statistical language to replicate this analysis, are finally discussed."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Financial stock market data can be rather challenging to analyze without adequate tools. Fortunately, libraries such as Python's *pandas* module make working with financial and time-series data very straightforward. The *pandas* library efficiently indexes time-sensitive data, supports operations for time-series of different frequencies, handles \"as of\" data imputation, and even provides functions conducive to stock value analysis with respect to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate *pandas* capabilities, we put the toolset to work on momentum analysis. Existing research indicates three types of momentum: 1) Short (1 month), 2) Intermediate (6-12 months), and 3) Long (3-5 years) [1,6,7]. This research reveals that both short and long term momentums exhibit reversal in short and long term future values. In contrast, intermediate term momentum demonstrates continued stock portfolio performance over intermediate future periods. Additionally, studies argue the best strategy is to use a lookback period of one year with a holding period of three months when determining when to buy or sell [7]. These are interesting principles and their analysis using real, historical stock values make for a great case study to evaluate Python and *pandas* for financial data applications. As such, a mock-up stock portofilio consisting of Texas Instruments (TXN), ON Semiconductor (ON), Nexperia (NXPI), Diodes (DIOD), and Maxim (MXIM) stocks will be reviewed and cumulative returns and momentum analyzed.\n",

    "### 2) Exploratory Data Analysis - Stock Price and Cumulative Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore these stocks, prior to further analysis, we have plotted both stock prices and cumulative returns across the most recent 3 Month, 1 Year, 3 Year, and 10 Year Periods. These plots are divided into 3 rows: 1) Stock Prices, 2) Cumulative Returns with Standardized Scale, 3) Cumulative Returns with Zoomed Scale, and are shown below the next code chunk. To provide a better picture of the data, cumulative returns are displayed with two different y-scale ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stock Prices** While we do not have the NXPI data element prior to August 2010, it is definitely apparent that NXPI has had a tremendously successful time in the market since inception. With prices ranging from approximately \\$14 in 2010 all the way to approximately \\$110 in 2017, it is followed next by TXN with an ending price of only approximately $80 in 2017. Although NXPI has had the most successful upward trend in the long-term, it also appears the most volatile. We notice, especially in the 3 year range, that there are much larger peaks and valleys than in the other prices. This factor likely attributes NXPI as a higher risk stock option than others plotted at its side. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cumulative Returns** The formula for cumulative returns is:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> $\\frac{(Current Price of Security - Original Price of Security)}{(Original Price of Security)}$     [2] </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This computation allows us to assess aggregate gain or loss from an initialized starting date. These plots display return percentages in decimal form. The second row of cumulative return plots provide us context toward aggregate gains in the short term versus long term, showing the powerful plunge of NXPI in the early years of inception. However, what was difficult to understand in the stock price visualizations is that NXPI does not actually take the win in the intermediate 1-3 year terms. As we dive into the scaled visuals of these same values, we find that DIOD, second to last in cumulative returns over the 10 year period, takes the win by nearly 20% in the 1 year period. This goes to show that buy and hold methodologies are very important to your overall investment strategy!"

    "Short term momentum is calculated for returns over a lookback period of one month and a heatmap is produced using *matplotlib* to visualize these results. The momentum strategy Sharpe Ratio heatmap shows positive values in red and negative values in blue. We expect short term periods to exhibit inverted outcomes compared to long term periods. We can see from this visualization a strong positive momentum calculated over a lookback period of 2-9 days and holding period of 1-11 days, both roughly 1 week. However, these are still not extremely dense in color as they indicate only moderate outcomes. With the exception of the first 2-9 days, it appears Sharpe Ratio values produce a net positive trend over the short term, which correlates with theory since the most recent trends in daily price changes were negative per the cumulative returns plots discussed previously."

It is important to note that we see a strong negative momentum at a lookback period of 3.75 months and holding period of almost 2 years. While we see a strong positive momentum with lookback at 4.5-6.5 months and holding at 0-3 months, we observe far more negative Sharpe Ratios for our intermediate term momentum compared to short term momentum, supporting research's claim that trends may continue in the intermediate term."

The momentum strategy Sharpe Ratio heatmap again shows positive values in red and negative values in blue. It is interesting that the first couple lookback periods show a high Sharpe ratio, even across longer holding periods. However, the Sharpe ratio begins to decrease, only showing high values in the lookback period through 10 months and only for holding periods through 4 months. Following this, there appears to only be  0 or negative Sharpe ratios for combinations of lookback and holding periods. This analysis confirms the belief that long term momentum results are similar to those of short term momentum results, in the fact that there will be a return reversal. This portfolio analysis confirms existing research, long term momentum is not the optimal momentum type."

    "\n",
    "According to current research [7], the best strategy theory is to use the intermediate momentum combination of a 12 month lookback window with a 3 month holding period. Again, this is a theory and may not be the best strategy for every portfolio. The contents of a portfolio will influence the parameters of lookback and holding combination resulting in the best strategy and as always anomalies will occur. Evaluation of this portfolio may not result in the best strategy theory holding true, as the dataset is based on influencing factors. The portfolio used in this case study lacks diversity, all stocks are semiconductor related corporations. A portfolio built on one sector, especially one specialty, increases the likelihood of a stock's performance directly impacting another. "

To accomplish this we will use the backtesting function developed earlier and output multiple Sharpe ratio metrics, providing the capability to derive high and low-level insights. Simply, we start with three momentum types, each assigned a large number of Sharpe ratio metrics based on lookback and holding combination calculations, then analyze these metrics to identify the best strategy. The first metric we will discuss is the highest-level metric derived from each momentum type, the overall Sharpe ratio mean. While this metric does not help us identify the existence or frequency of return reversals and/or the severity of a reversal, it can be useful in the evaluation of the entire momentum type performance."

    "## Discussion and Future Work\n",
    "Proper stock market analysis and data mining require an adequate tool suite for effective insights. After performing portfolio analysis for five different stocks, which consisted of some basic exploratory analysis, a review of short, intermediate, and long term momentums, and a comparison against theory's best momentum strategy, we agree that Python, with *pandas*, meets such needs. We were able to confirm momentum performance exhibits the same characteristics of continuum and reversal as existing research suggests. Our assessment using Python also revealed that our portfolio's best momentum strategy closely matches that theorized to be optimum (one year lookback, three month holding period). To summarize, our analysis and existing research were both in alignment with one another, supporting the argument that Python provides the tools necessary to analyze stock market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As extension of this effort, future works include three items of interest. The first is to analyze a more diversified stock portfolio consisting of stocks from more than just a single industry such as was performed herein. With such diversification, we would plan to include at least twenty stocks in contrast to the mere five included in this case study. The second item of interest for future work would be to also extend our application into other areas such as future contract rolling. Doing so would extend demonstration of Python's financial data efficiencies. Finally, the third item of interest would be to replicate all these efforts using the R programming language. This would enable us to review R's financial data capabilities and allow us to compare both Python and R in terms of financial and time-series data efficiencies."
